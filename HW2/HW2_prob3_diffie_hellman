Alice and Bob uses Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol by:
    - First Bob and Alice agree to use the public exchange which has the generator "g" which is usually a prime number
    and is small and "n"
    - Alice would pick a number "a" then she will do the calculation of (g^a) mod n = A
        -> A will be in the public exchange
    - Bob would pick a number "b" then he will do the calculation of (g^b) mode n = B
        -> B will be in the public exchange
    - In Alice private exchange, she will grab Bob's exchange "B" from the public and combine it with hers.
        -> Now she would get B^a or (g^ab) mod n
    - Same with Alice, Bob would grab Alice's key "B" from the public exchange and combine it with his.
        -> Now he would get A^b or (g^ba) mod n

    => From here Alice and Bob would have the same key. If hacker wants to break that, they will have to reverse
    engineering this. It is difficult as they only know the key in the public exchange which is g^a and g^b. They
    could multiple it, but they will only get g^(a+b) which is not the same as g^ab.
